# Cycles-X Bot


# ❓About
the Cycles-X bot is a bot designed for the Blender Community Discord. Its purpose is to assist server users with blender-related topics, and provide some fun activities for them to use.


## Setup
If you want to use this program for your own bots, you will need to setup the token variable. 

In the main folder, create a `.env` file, then in the file write the line `CYCLES_X_BOT_TOKEN=""`. You can then entire your bot token ID and the bot should run.
